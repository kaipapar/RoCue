Since the directions for the final pathfinding needs to be returned as an array of coordinates
the simple path finding needs to be returned as a array of coordinates.

Once player is spotted directions are to the location of the player.
For every turn that player is in line of sight the directions are updated
and orcs location is updated with those directions for every turn.

when the end of the directions are reached the orc just stays still.



struct Position* directions = {};
int cursor = 0;
int* cursorPTR = &cursor;
while (directions[cursorPTR] != 0)
{
    seekPlayer();
}

void seekPlayer(orc, player, map, directions, cursorPTR)
{
    if (lineofsight(orc, player) = true)
        directions = simplePathFinding(orc, player)
        cursor = 0;

    moveOrc(directions, cursorPTR) --> moves cursor forward by one
}

void moveOrc(struct Position* directions, int* cursorPTR)
{
    orc->pos.y = directions[*cursorPTR].y;
    orc->pos.x = directions[*cursorPTR].x;
    *cursorPTR++;
}
