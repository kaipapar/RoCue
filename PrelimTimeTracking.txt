2.6.23 bugfixing - Kaipapar
    13 - 15:45 -- Weird bug with FOV, leaving some areas not in fov as visible.
                The bug was caused by wrong call order. Then I continued with making code more concise.
                I also created a random path that the enemy walks along when it hasn't spotted the player.
                I ended with trying to get the enemy to disappear... It seems that the rules regarding it 
                are different than of other entities
