## Installation
## About the project
### Preamble
This project was started as an end-of-course project for a C coding course at Turku University of Applied Sciences. Here's the link to the aptly named SystemSoftwareProject-repository (https://github.com/kaipapar/SystemSoftwareProject). Even though we got a great grade for the project a couple of the members of the group decided to do more with the code base we created. This repository is the end cause of that and it will be updated along the summer of 2023.
### Focus
Since this is a recreational project we don't have any fire up our rectums about deadlines and the sort. This frees us to focus on code and project quality. Which is why we will overhaul a major part of the code base at the beginning of this project.
