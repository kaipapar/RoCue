# RoCue

## Installation
(For now this code only runs on Linux, we haven't tested for Mac OS and a Windows port is coming some time in the future)
1. Clone this repo
2. In RoCue/Code directory run:
  1. make
  2. ./Rogue
  3. On subsequent play sessions you only need to run the program with step 2. If you want to recompile you run [make clean], [make], [./Rogue].
  Enjoy!
## About the project

### Preamble
This project was started as an end-of-course project for a C coding course at Turku University of Applied Sciences. Here's the link to the aptly named SystemSoftwareProject-repository (https://github.com/kaipapar/SystemSoftwareProject). Even though we got a great grade for the project a couple of the members of the group decided to do more with the code base we created. This repository is the end cause of that and it will be updated along the summer of 2023.

### Focus
Since this is a recreational project we don't have any fire up our rectums about deadlines and the sort. This frees us to focus on code and project quality. Which is why we will overhaul a major part of the code base at the beginning of this project.

### Goals

### Scope
Full list of things to do in ./TODO
Once we have gotten our codebase to an acceptable level we will either port our project to an embedded environment or try some ML reinforcement learning _stuff_ on our project. On the ML side of things the devs are noobs, but we might have a go at it.

### Technologies
