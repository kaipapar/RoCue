1. initialize variables after menuDraw
2. find data flows and give pointers as arguments
3. localize variables

floorstuct:
1. replace z axis from map with a struct that includes 
all relevant data for a floor:
    1. map
    2. orc
    3. coinArray
    4. stairs
    5. start pos
    6. exit pos 
    
2. create a array of x floor structs --> this is how the z coordinate is replaced
3. make all data flow _nice_
