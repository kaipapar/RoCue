1. initialize variables after menuDraw
2. find data flows and give pointers as arguments
3. localize variables

floorstuct:
1. replace z axis from map with a struct that includes 
all relevant data for a floor:
    1. map
    2. orc
    3. coinArray
    4. stairs
    5. start pos
    6. exit pos 
    
2. create a array of x floor structs --> this is how the z coordinate is replaced
3. make all data flow _nice_
4. best case --> fimctopms tjat meed 


problems:
1. Stairs don't go through FOV, seen always.   
2. weird glitch: while moving a terminal cursor looking character flashes in different places on the map. Memory leak? It does this also on the points board.
3. When interacting with stairs the game jumps from floor 0 -> 6
